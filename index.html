      <p class="words line1">To: Princess</p>
      <p class="words line2">My dearest Princess,</p>
      <p class="words line3">You are the softest hello in a noisy world and the sharpest eye-roll when I act foolish;</p>
      <p class="words line4">the way you laugh like sunlight spilling across an Aegean morning makes every ordinary day feel like a holiday.</p>
      <p class="words line5">I love the way your hair catches the light and the way your stubborn little grin announces you won the argument before it even started.</p>
      <p class="words line6">You are fierce in the best way — a tiny Greek hurricane with a heart made of honey and ancient sea‑salt.</p>
      <p class="words line7">Sometimes you are playful and a little mean in the sweetest way, and honestly I love you more for it.</p>
      <p class="words line8">You tease me like a practiced poet and correct me like a gentle teacher, and both make me want to be better.</p>
      <p class="words line9">Your kindness is quiet but vast, like a harbor that always welcomes me home no matter how lost I feel.</p>
      <p class="words line10">You worry too much about small things and laugh too loudly at the big ones, and both of those things are infuriatingly adorable.</p>
      <p class="words line11">I love your hands — the ones that hold my phone when I'm distracted, that make soup when I'm tired, that tug me back when I wander.</p>
      <p class="words line12">You are sweetness wrapped in sharpness: baklava and lemon peel, syrup and spice, calm sea and quick storm.</p>
      <p class="words line13">I love that you are proud of where you come from, that your stories carry islands and olive trees and stubborn family love.</p>
      <p class="words line14">And I love teasing you about how fiercely you protect your secrets — you hide smiles like treasures and roll your eyes like punctuation.</p>
      <p class="words line15">Sometimes I call you my little tyrant of charm and you frown, and that frown becomes the thing I memorize like a blessing.</p>
      <p class="words line16">When you speak in Greek words that I do not fully understand, I still hear home — a language that wraps me up and makes me braver.</p>
      <p class="words line17">You make ordinary plans into myths I want to live inside forever, and even your smallest wishes feel like instructions for how to be better.</p>
      <p class="words line18">Thank you for being stubborn enough to argue with me and kind enough to forgive me when I lose.</p>
      <p class="words line19">Thank you for being my soft place to land and my loud reason to laugh, for being myth and mischief and so much mercy.</p>
      <p class="words line20">I promise to love you through the silly, the sharp, the dramatic, and the quiet, to learn your rhythms and keep catching you when you jump.</p>
      <p class="words line21">Because you are worth every brave thing I might do and every foolish arrow I might follow.</p>
      <p class="words line22">So stay stubborn, stay sweet, stay gloriously, maddeningly, beautifully Greek — and stay mine, Princess.</p>
      <p class="words line23">With all my ridiculous heart,</p>
      <p class="words line24">— Elrique</p>
