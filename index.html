          <div class="words line1">To: Princess</div>
          <div class="words line2">My dearest Princess,</div>
          <div class="words line3">You are the softest hello in a noisy world and the sharpest eye-roll when I act foolish,</div>
          <div class="words line4">the way you laugh like sunlight spilling across an Aegean morning makes every ordinary day feel like a holiday,</div>
          <div class="words line5">I love the way your hair catches the light and the way your stubborn little grin announces you won the argument before it even started,</div>
          <div class="words line6">you are fierce in the best way — a tiny Greek hurricane with a heart made of honey and ancient sea-salt,</div>
          <div class="words line7">sometimes you are playful and a little mean in the sweetest way, and honestly I love you more for it,</div>
          <div class="words line8">you tease me like a practiced poet and correct me like a gentle teacher, and both make me want to be better,</div>
          <div class="words line9">your kindness is quiet but vast, like a harbor that always welcomes me home no matter how lost I feel,</div>
          <div class="words line10">you worry too much about small things and laugh too loudly at the big ones, and both of those things are infuriatingly adorable,</div>
          <div class="words line11">I love your hands — the ones that hold my phone when I'm distracted, that make soup when I'm tired, that tug me back when I wander,</div>
          <div class="words line12">you are sweetness wrapped in sharpness: baklava and lemon peel, syrup and spice, calm sea and quick storm,</div>
          <div class="words line13">I love that you are proud of where you come from, that your stories carry islands and olive trees and stubborn family love,</div>
          <div class="words line14">and I love teasing you about how fiercely you protect your secrets — you know you hide smiles like treasures and roll your eyes like punctuation,</div>
          <div class="words line15">sometimes I call you my little tyrant of charm and you frown, and that frown becomes the thing I memorize like a blessing,</div>
          <div class="words line16">when you speak in Greek words that I do not fully understand, I still hear home — a language that wraps me up and makes me braver,</div>
          <div class="words line17">you make ordinary plans into myths I want to live inside forever, and even your smallest wishes feel like instructions for how to be better,</div>
          <div class="words line18">thank you for being stubborn enough to argue with me and kind enough to forgive me when I lose,</div>
          <div class="words line19">thank you for being my soft place to land and my loud reason to laugh, for being myth and mischief and so much mercy,</div>
          <div class="words line20">I promise to love you through the silly, the sharp, the dramatic, and the quiet, to learn your rhythms and keep catching you when you jump,</div>
          <div class="words line21">because you are worth every brave thing I might do and every foolish arrow I might follow,</div>
          <div class="words line22">so stay stubborn, stay sweet, stay gloriously, maddeningly, beautifully Greek — and stay mine, Princess,</div>
          <div class="words line23">With all my ridiculous heart,</div>
          <div class="words line24">— Elrique</div>
